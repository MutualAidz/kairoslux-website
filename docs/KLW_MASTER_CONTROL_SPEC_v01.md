Kairos Lux Works – Master Control Specification (v0.1)

These are the source-of-truth constraints for all work on the Kairos Lux Works website, copy, and related materials.

Any AI or human working on this project must:

Treat this document as binding.

Follow all Non‑Negotiables (NN).

Implement all Requirements (REQ) unless explicitly marked “optional” in a later version.

If a proposed change conflicts with this spec, the spec wins until you explicitly revise it.

SECTION A: NON‑NEGOTIABLES (BANNED ITEMS)

If you use these, you fail.

NN‑01: NO “Small Consultancy.”
Never describe the firm as “small” or just a “consultancy.” Prefer:

“Boutique strategy partner”

“Studio”

“Guild”

“Practice”

NN‑02: NO “Kairos Brief.”
The newsletter name is “Kairos Circuit.”
Never use “Kairos Brief” or “(working title)” anywhere.

NN‑03: NO standalone “Talks / Panels / Retreats” product card.
Do not create a product card whose whole title is “Talks, panels, and retreats.”
Formation should be woven through the service paths (Discern / Design / Mission Impact), not sold as random one‑off speaking gigs.

NN‑04: NO “Growth Myths.”
Do not use the phrase “Silicon Valley’s growth myths.”
Use instead: “the dominant Silicon Valley narrative of speed, scale, and disruption.”

NN‑05: NO “Audit.”
Never use the word “Audit” for our work.
Prefer: “Mission Readiness Sprint” or “Deep Discernment Review” depending on context.

NN‑06: NO “Experiments.”
Do not use the word “Experiments” (reads as unstructured, unserious).
Prefer phrases like:

“Focused, high‑impact changes”

“High‑leverage workflows”

“Well‑structured pilots” (for specific projects, but not as the section title).

NN‑07: NO “Mission Pilots” as a section header.
Do not title the implementation section “Mission Pilots.”
Preferred: “Mission Impact Work” or “Mission Impact Enhancement.”

NN‑08: NO present‑tense “encyclical RAG” claims.
Do not claim we already run RAG pipelines on encyclicals and magisterial texts as a product.
You may say:

CST and Church texts shape our discernment and decisions now.

Technical tools that operationalize this are in development.

NN‑09: NO niche sector headers.
Do not use headers like “Real Estate Finance” or “Catholic Finance” for offerings.
Use broader, inviting headers like:

“Operational & Financial Analytics”

“Mission‑aligned Capital & Relationships”
so a wide range of institutions can see themselves in the work.

NN‑10: NO “Prompt Engineering” branding.
Do not describe the work as “prompt engineering” as the main value.
Prefer:

“Data strategy”

“Institutional memory”

“Knowledge architecture”

“Decision systems”

SECTION B: CANONICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST‑HAVES)

These are positive constraints: things the site must include or reflect, unless we explicitly version them later.

Identity & Structure

REQ‑01 – Entity Structure
Clearly distinguish:

Kairos Lux Works LLC – for‑profit, Texas‑based, active; boutique strategy partner & practice.

Kairos Labs – emerging non‑profit / fiscally sponsored research & reskilling arm (in formation).

REQ‑02 – Hero Tone
Hero text must combine:

Institutional pressure (financial, cultural, operational), and

Moral / spiritual upswing (mission, hope, flourishing).

It must include the phrase: “the kind of economy Christ calls us to build.”

REQ‑03 – Tagline
Use exactly: “Catholic Social Teaching, engineered for AI.”
CST comes first.

REQ‑04 – Contact Email
Primary public email: hello@kairoslux.ai

.
You may also expose felix@kairoslux.ai

for deeper partnership / funding conversations.

Service Architecture – “The Paths”

All services must be intelligible as a flow:

Discern & Clarify → Design & Decide → Mission Impact Work (three paths)

REQ‑05 – Flow Naming
Use the three‑path language explicitly somewhere:

Path 1: Discern & Clarify

Path 2: Design & Decide

Path 3: Mission Impact Work

REQ‑06 – Path 1 (Discern & Clarify)
Must include both of these named offerings (even if lightly):

“AI Discernment Call” (initial triage / discovery).

“CST & AI Foundations Seminar” (leadership / board formation).

REQ‑07 – Path 2 (Design & Decide)
Must include:

“Discernment Sprint” (2–3 weeks; strategy + readiness).

“Deep Discernment Review” (for larger networks / federations).

REQ‑08 – Path 3 (Mission Impact Work)
Must make clear that we gravitate toward:

Relationship & Capital Intelligence (donors, investors, stakeholders).

Humanitarian / Social Ministries (social services, health, relief, etc.).

Universities & Formation (Catholic universities, houses of formation, networks).

These can be articulated as “areas we’re drawn to / examples,” not rigid verticals.

Content & Theology

REQ‑09 – Pope Leo XIV Quotes
Include 2–3 short quotes from Pope Leo XIV (AI teaching). For example:

“We need an AI that reflects the Creator’s design: intelligent, relational and guided by love.” – Pope Leo XIV

“Authentic wisdom has more to do with recognizing the true meaning of life than with the availability of data.” – Pope Leo XIV

“In order to ensure true progress, human dignity and the common good must remain our priority.” – Pope Leo XIV

(Exact wording can be tuned, but the themes must remain.)

REQ‑10 – Pope Leo XIII Quote (Rerum Novarum)
Include one quote from Rerum Novarum in the About / Labs / Vision area. For example:

“No practical solution to this question will be found apart from the intervention of religion and of the Church.” – Pope Leo XIII

REQ‑11 – Formation Definition
Whenever “formation” is described, emphasize:

“Formation that clarifies” – honest about disruption and constraints,

not just “formation that lowers anxiety.”

Formation is about mature discernment, not vibe‑management.

Kairos Labs (Emerging Non‑Profit)

REQ‑12 – Labs Focus
Kairos Labs must be framed around:

“Dignified and creative work” in the AI age.

“Worker reskilling” and pathways for people whose roles are changing or at risk.

REQ‑13 – Attraction for Capital Partners
Somewhere in the Labs / Vision area, invite capital partners in language like:

“Building the infrastructure for the Church’s AI future.”

Emphasize that support seeds research, reskilling, and shared tools for the wider Church.

REQ‑14 – Attraction for Technical Talent
Labs copy should explicitly mention:

“Action‑research” (learning by doing with real institutions).

“Turning unstructured conversations into institutional memory”
(e.g., graphs / knowledge architecture) to attract engineers and data people who care about meaning.

Visuals & Frontend Code

These requirements guide the frontend implementation and design system.

REQ‑15 – Aesthetic Vibe
Overall aesthetic: “Warm, Futuristic, Neo‑Gothic.”
Think: luminous, stained glass, gold accents, deep navy backgrounds, real depth.

REQ‑16 – Palette

#071428 – Navy (Main background)

#0b1930 – Soft navy (alternate background)

#f5c565 – Gold (accents, CTAs, highlights)

#f8f5f0 – Off‑white (text sections, cards)

REQ‑17 – Scroll Rhythm
As you scroll, backgrounds must alternate:

Dark (navy) → Light (off‑white) → Dark (soft navy) → Light → …
Never have two light sections back‑to‑back.

REQ‑18 – Image Paths
Frontend code should assume these image paths:

Hero: /images/hero-rose-window.png

Method / Compass: /images/compass-cross.png

Labs / Vision: /images/labs-arched-path.png

About: /images/about-cross.png

Logo: /images/logo-klw.png

REQ‑19 – Tech Stack
Default tech stack for this site is:

React + Vite

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Copy and structure should map cleanly to a componentized React layout.

Data Privacy & Sovereignty

REQ‑20 – Privacy Signal
The site must clearly signal data sovereignty and privacy‑first AI.

Position Kairos Lux Works as building:

“Privacy‑first, sovereign AI practices and workflows,”

distinct from Silicon Valley’s data‑harvesting, ad‑tech, or surveillance models.

This is a key selling point for dioceses, religious orders, universities, and foundations.

End of v0.1.
If you need to change any NN or REQ, bump the version (v0.2, v0.3…) and track changes in the revision log.
