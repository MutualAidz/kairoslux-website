Kairos Lux Works – Revision History & Feedback Log (v0.1)

Use this file to track how the website copy and structure evolve over time, and how each version relates to the Master Control Spec.

Whenever you create a new major version (v0.2, v0.3, …), add an entry here.

How to use this log

For each version, capture:

Version ID (e.g., Bolt_v1, Bolt_v2, ChatGPT_v0.1, Site_v1_live).

Date (approximate is fine).

Source (Bolt, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, manual edits).

Summary of changes.

Key feedback from Felix.

Spec compliance notes (where it violated or satisfied NNs / REQs).

Decision (adopted, partially adopted, superseded).

This lets us see how ideas developed over time and avoids re‑introducing old mistakes.

Known historical versions (to be filled in as you upload them)

Latest notable change

Version ID: Codex_Workflow_Doc_Addition
Date: 2024-12-23
Source: Codex
Summary: Added PROJECT_LLM_WORKFLOW.md and linked it from AI_WORKFLOW_SOP.md; clarified project-specific LLM operating rules and documentation alignment expectations.
Spec compliance notes: Supports NN rules on verification and SSOT alignment.
Decision: Adopted.

Mission pilots language used as a section label.

Feedback from Felix (paraphrased):

Rename newsletter to “Kairos Circuit”, short, alliterative, two words.

Do not call this a “small consultancy”; prefer boutique, studio, or practice language.

Do not present “talks / panels / retreats” as a standalone offering.

Broaden “mission pilots” framing so people don’t think only in terms of pilots.

Spec compliance (retroactive):

Violates NN‑01, NN‑02, NN‑03, NN‑07.

Partially aligned on CST themes but missing clear three‑path structure (REQ‑05–08).

Decision:
Superseded. Useful only as a historical reference for what not to reintroduce.

2. Intermediate revisions (Gemini / Claude commentary, before Master Spec)

Use this slot once you gather those drafts. For each, note what was improved (e.g., better mission language, clearer Labs vs LLC split) and what drift remained (e.g., sector titles too narrow, guild confusion).

3. Master Control Spec (this document) – alignment point

Version ID: MASTER_CONTROL_SPEC_v01
Source: Gemini + Felix + ChatGPT
Summary:

Formalized Non‑Negotiables (NN‑01 … NN‑10) and Requirements (REQ‑01 … REQ‑20).

Clarified service architecture (three paths).

Locked in key phrases (tagline, “the kind of economy Christ calls us to build,” newsletter name “Kairos Circuit”).

Added data sovereignty as a core selling point.

Decision:
This is the binding control document for all future versions until explicitly updated.

4. Canonical Website Copy v0.1 (this project)

Version ID: KLW_WEBSITE_COPY_v01_CANONICAL
Source: ChatGPT (current project) + Felix feedback to date
Summary:

Implements three‑path structure: Discern & Clarify → Design & Decide → Mission Impact Work.

Integrates Pope Leo XIV quotes and a Pope Leo XIII quote.

Distinguishes clearly between Kairos Lux Works LLC and Kairos Labs.

Introduces explicit data sovereignty / institutional memory language.

Frames Labs as research + worker reskilling; Guild as long‑term ecosystem.

Spec compliance (snapshot):

NN‑01 … NN‑10: appears compliant (no “small consultancy,” no “Kairos Brief,” no “Audit,” no “experiments” language).

REQ‑01 … REQ‑04: satisfied.

REQ‑05 … REQ‑08: three paths and named offerings present.

REQ‑09 … REQ‑14: quotes and Labs framing present.

REQ‑20: privacy / data sovereignty signaled.

Decision:
Treat as canonical starting point for website copy. Future changes should reference this entry.

5. Site beta – Compass → Mission Domains → Discernment Steps (in progress)

Version ID:
Site_beta_2025-12-23_midpage_IA

Date:
2025-12-23

Source:
Felix feedback + Bolt (Claude Sonnet) + ChatGPT architecture guidance

Summary of changes:
- Moved “mission work domains” upward near the Kairos Compass so visitors see recognizable workflows earlier.
- Began reframing “paths” as a progressive journey (discussion: “movements” → “discernment steps”).
- Identified need to consolidate the three path sections into a single dynamic journey module (horizontal/scroll‑synced), but current beta still reads as overly vertical / too expanded.

Key feedback from Felix (paraphrased):
- Compass must feel shorter; remove redundant “What we mean by redesigning work” callout.
- Mission domains should connect directly to Compass (mission-first framing).
- The three paths should unfold dynamically/horizontally; avoid three long vertical sections and avoid duplication (especially repeating domain cards).
- Step 1 must communicate “people arrive differently” without becoming a rigid product ladder.

Spec compliance notes:
- Must preserve explicit “Path 1/2/3” naming somewhere (REQ‑05) even if UI labels shift to “steps.”
- Mission domains expansion should not remove required Path 3 “areas we gravitate toward” examples (REQ‑08).
- Ensure scroll rhythm alternation remains true as new “journey module” is added (REQ‑17).

Decision:
Partially adopted. Next implementation milestone is the consolidated “Discernment steps” journey module with progressive disclosure and (optionally) scroll‑synced highlighting.
