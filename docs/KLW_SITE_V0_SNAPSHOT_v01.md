## 1. High-level notes

- This version is essentially a **holding / splash page**.
- It establishes the Kairos Lux name and the core CST + AI tagline.
- There are **no service descriptions, navigation links, or multi-section layout** rendered in the scraped HTML.
- Contact is via a single email link.

- **Status note:** `Site in progress.`

## 4. Relationship to later versions

Later Bolt-hosted versions (v1–v3) attempt to:

- Expand this minimal splash into a **full single-page site** with hero, services, method, Labs, and newsletter sections.
- Preserve the **CST + AI** framing but deepen the language around **discernment, mission impact, and workflow design**.

This v0 snapshot should be treated as the **pre-copy baseline** that existed before the more detailed KLW_CANONICAL copy was developed.
