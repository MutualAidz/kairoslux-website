# KLW Website SOP (to prevent drift)

## Source of truth
1) `docs/KLW_MASTER_CONTROL_SPEC_v02.md` (constraints + style rules)
2) `docs/KLW_WEBSITE_COPY_v02_CANONICAL.md` (approved copy)
3) `docs/KLW_REVISION_HISTORY_v02.md` (what changed and why)

## Update cycle (every iteration)
1. Decide the goal of this iteration (1–3 bullets).
2. Make the smallest set of edits to achieve it.
3. Run a quick visual check (desktop + mobile).
4. Capture 3 screenshots:
   - Hero + nav
   - One mid-page section (e.g., Kairos Compass)
   - Footer / contact
5. Update `docs/KLW_REVISION_HISTORY_v02.md`:
   - Date
   - What changed (short)
   - Why (tie to spec / feedback)
6. If a decision changes IA/copy/UX, capture it in `docs/KLW_ALIGNMENT_QUEUE.md`; remove only after SSOT is updated + change is verified.
7. Commit to GitHub `main`.
8. Confirm on staging: https://beta.kairoslux.ai

## Content rules (hard constraints)
- Do not invent offerings (no “panels”, “retreats”, etc.) unless explicitly approved in canonical copy.
- Avoid unclear umbrella terms (“Guild”) unless defined and approved.
- Keep language precise; do not claim endorsements or quotes unless verified and cited.
