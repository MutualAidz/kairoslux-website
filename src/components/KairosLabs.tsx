              Kairos Labs – dignified and creative work in the AI age

                Kairos Labs is the emerging non-profit arm of the Kairos Guild—the wider ecosystem of method, institute, and consultancy we are building around AI and Catholic Social Teaching.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Kairos Labs focuses on formation and research around the future of work: worker reskilling for the AI age with a CST moral backbone; small cohorts and learning circles among those most exposed to automation; and tools that help communities redesign work rather than simply lose it.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Labs will weave together action-research (following real teams as AI enters their work), theological reflection, and technical prototyping. The goal is to generate methods, curricula, and shared tools that can be reused by religious orders and universities, social ministries and humanitarian agencies.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                As an early offering, we are also prototyping <strong>Kairos Circuit</strong> – a short, periodic brief on Catholic AI projects, emerging Church teaching on AI, and what Pope Leo and others are saying and doing. You can register interest through the contact form.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                If this resonates—whether you are in consecrated life, a university or research centre, a foundation, or a social ministry—we would be glad to discern together what a partnership could look like. Use the contact form below and your message will reach Felix and the Kairos Lux Works team.
